This folder contains the domains database related files.

These files are not the physical database which is used during development.

The schema needs to be exported to the actual DBMS server on the local machine.

For integration testing purposes the inital state of the database is that all tables are empty.

The integration tests are designed to fufil the descriptions within the scenarios.

The database tables should be returned to the inital state after a test has completed.
