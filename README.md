Scenario
========

You have been asked to develop Bookface, a social networking site for people who love reading, and always have their face in a book. The site will allow avid readers to comment on their favourite books, and to read the comments made by others on their favourite books, and other books by their favourite authors.

◦Users must register before they can submit comments on a book. 
◦Users should choose a screen name and they should supply an email address.
◦ The site should list authors together with their books.
◦Comments are made on books, not on authors. 
◦Users can add authors if they are not already there, and they can add books to authors. 
◦Your program should list the favourite books of a user and be able to see other members of the site who listed those books as being among their favourite books.
        
        
You should use either JEE or Spring to assist you in implementing this work (yes, Play and Spring Roo are allowed). You may carry this coursework out in groups (up to four members inclusive).
